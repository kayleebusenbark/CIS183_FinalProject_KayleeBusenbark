This app helps users make the most of their ingredients by generating personalized meal ideas based on what they already have in their fridge and/or pantry.  
You can search for recipes based off what you have in your pantry. It wil show you all recipes that contain all those ingredients and recipes that have 1-2 ingredients missing.
You can also create your own recipes, update those recipes, and delete those recipes.
You can add custom ingredients.

Room for improvement:
- have ingredients have predefined measurement types
- more error checking on adding custom ingredients
